Hi, I’m **Rana Barghout**, a PhD student at the **University of Toronto** and **Vector Institute**, working under the supervision of **Krishna Mahadevan** (Laboratory for Metabolic Systems Engineering – [lmse.utoronto.ca](https://lmse.utoronto.ca)) and **Benjamin Sanchez-Lengeling** (Chemical Cognition Lab – [www.chemicalcognition.org](https://www.chemcognition.org)).

My research focuses on **predicting compound-protein interaction properties** and integrating them into **genome-scale metabolic models**. I also develop **constraint-based modeling optimization frameworks** for metabolic cellular systems and explore modeling these systems using **graph neural networks**.
